# About this repo

In this repo, you can find **8 common design patterns** of React!

Including: **custom hook**, **compound components**, **controlled props**, **multiple custom hooks**, **props collection**, **props getter**, **state initialiser**, **state reducer**

This repo follows the step of the awesome course "[The Complete Guide to Advanced React Component Patterns](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-advanced-react-patterns/)" by Ohans Emmanuel. [His Repo](https://github.com/ohansemmanuel/advanced-react-patterns-ultrasimplified/tree/master)

Throughout the course, we build a Medium clap button with 8 different design patterns.

I used a different animation library than Ohans, but the design logic is the same. Feel free to checkout the repo and explore these patterns!

(I'd as well highly recommend taking the course!)
